            <h3>Food related website</h3>
            <p>Food hubs are a crucial, but often invisible, part of the local food system. They help small farms grow
                by offering a combination of production, distribution, and marketing services. There are now 236 food
                hubs in the U.S., with more popping up all the time. Some are physical spaces, some virtual online
                spaces, but all are concerned with connecting the dots between producers and consumers of food in local
                and regional food systems. Food hubs can be thought of as helpful middlemen that connect producers
                (farmers and ranchers) with institutional buyers (restaurants, hospitals, schools, etc) and end
                consumers. They help farmers gain access to larger markets so they can focus more on farming and less on
                marketing, distribution, etc.</p>

                    <h5>HAMBURGERS</h5>
                    <p>Chop garlic cloves on wooden surface then put in mortar and pestle.
                        Add salt and olive oil and make a paste.
                        Add this to the meat along with the Worcestershire and horseradish.
                        Mix everything and adjust ingredients to suit your taste.
                        When you make the patties place an indention in the middle of each one with your thumb (almost
                        all the way through). This keeps the burgers from shrinking. We like ours thick and I like them
                        to stay that way!</p>
